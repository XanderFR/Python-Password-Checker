# Python-Password-Checker
A Python program that checks if a password has been hacked. The program takes a password entered by the user and hashes it using the SHA1 algorithm. The program then sends a small portion of the hashed password to the 'pwnedpasswords.com' API which then sends back a list of hashed password segments and the number of times those passwords were hacked. The program then compares each hashed password segment in the list with the remaining portion of the hashed password originally entered by the user. If there is a match, it lets the user know the number of times that password has been hacked and that they should probably change it. Otherwise, the program prints a message on how everything is fine.
